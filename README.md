 *************************************************Brief process of the given below********************
 
 
1.Choose a weather API: There are many weather APIs available that you can use to fetch weather data. Some popular options include OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack, and AccuWeather. Choose one that suits your needs and register for an API key.

2.Set up your development environment: Install Node.js and a package manager like npm or yarn. You'll also need to install Next.js and React.js.

3.Create a new Next.js app: Use the create-next-app command to create a new app. This will set up the basic file structure and dependencies for yo3u.

4.Create a search bar component: Add a search bar component to your app where users can enter the name of the city they want to see the weather for.

5.Fetch data from the weather API: Use the API key you obtained in step 1 to fetch weather data for the specified city. You can use a library like Axios or fetch to make the API call.

6.Display the weather data: Once you have the weather data, you can display it in your app. Use React.js components to create a visually appealing display of the current weather conditions and 5-day forecast.

7.Style your app: Use CSS to style your app and make it look visually appealing. You can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI to make styling easier.

8.Test your app: Test your app to make sure it works as expected. Make sure it handles errors gracefully, such as when the user enters an invalid city name or the API call fails.
